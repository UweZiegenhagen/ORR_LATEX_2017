The above links use the generic mirror.ctan.org url which autoredirects to a CTAN mirror that should be reasonably nearby and reasonably up to date. However, perfect synchronization is not possible; if you have troubles following the links, your best bet is to choose explicitly from the list of CTAN mirrors (you'll need to append systems/texlive/tlnet to the top-level mirror urls given there to get to the TL area).
